# Camera Calibration

Camera calibration: A practical guide (theory with code). Compilation of theory from OpenCV, Andrew zisserman book and few online sources. I have tried my best to simplify things and explained in very practical manner.
theory can be found in the folder Documents :)
dependencies: OpenCV, numpy, python 2 (Becuase I use ROS ;))

How to use the code
1. Add your images to the Data folder (remember to remove the image which added to test the code)
2. edit the checker board pattern accordingly.
3. Code is explained here : https://opencv-python-tutroals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/py_tutorials/py_calib3d/py_calibration/py_calibration.html
